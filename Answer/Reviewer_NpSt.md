>**Q5.2:** The authors use a lot of doubtful 'without loss of generality'.

**A5.2:** Thanks and address. We have extended the application of our method to the Vasicek model while also conducting experiments involving various operator combinations, as shown in the following experiments,


#### Extension to Vasicek Model

The results of additional experiments on other operator combinations are shown below.

The experiments demonstrate that LSN with various combinations of symmetry operators consistently outperform PINN.
